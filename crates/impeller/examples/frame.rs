//! The thing to run first, and laid out as an interface rather than as a
//! gallery of shapes: rounded cards over their own blurred shadows, circles,
//! gradients clipped to rounded tracks, an image panel, a blend mode, and a run
//! of glyphs. All through the public API, naming no backend and reaching for
//! nothing below it.
//!
//! Arranged that way because the features are more convincing where they meet
//! than in isolation. A drop shadow is a blurred layer holding the shape it
//! belongs to, and it is only right if the blur reaches outside the bounds the
//! layer was given — which is a thing to look at rather than assert.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p impeller --example frame -- frame.ppm
//! ```
//!
//! The output is a binary PPM, which every image viewer reads and which needs
//! no encoder. Image encoding is out of scope for this project, and taking a
//! dependency on one so that an example could write a nicer file would be a
//! poor trade — `magick frame.ppm frame.png` converts it, and so does anything
//! else.
