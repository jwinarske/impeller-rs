//! How a per-vertex or per-sprite color combines with what the paint produced.
//!
//! `dart:ui` passes a blend mode to `drawVertices` and `drawAtlas` saying this,
//! and both operations were marked complete here while supporting exactly one
//! of the modes -- a multiply, which is `Modulate` and was not a choice.
//!
//! The shader's formulas are checked against `impeller_hal`'s, which existed
//! first and are the software reference the conformance tests already compare
//! hardware to. Neither was derived from the other, which is what makes the
//! comparison worth making: a transcription error in the shader shows as a
//! disagreement rather than as two copies of the same mistake.
