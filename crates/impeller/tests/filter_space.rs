//! Every spelling of "filter this" measures its lengths in the same space.
//!
//! A caller's blur sigma is stated in the space they were drawing in -- what
//! `dart:ui` means by it, and what upstream honors by scaling with
//! `effect_transform.Basis()`. `docs/architecture.md` records the conversion of
//! this renderer's sigmas out of device space for that reason, and says it happens
//! once, when a layer is opened.
//!
//! It happened to the layer only. The `ImageFilter` handed alongside was not
//! converted, so under a scale of two the same eight-pixel blur came out as
//! sixteen through three spellings and eight through two:
//!
//! | spelling | was | now |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Layer::with_blur` | 16 | 16 |
//! | `Paint::with_image_filter` | 16 | 16 |
//! | `Layer::with_backdrop_blur` | 16 | 16 |
//! | `Canvas::save_layer_filtered` | **8** | 16 |
//! | `Canvas::save_layer_backdrop` | **8** | 16 |
//!
//! What makes that a defect rather than two documented conventions is the third
//! row against the fourth: both hand an `ImageFilter::Blur` to a layer, and the
//! one that goes through a paint was scaled while the one that goes through
//! `save_layer_filtered` was not. One value in one type meant two different
//! things depending on which call received it.
//!
//! # What deliberately still differs
//!
//! A morphology radius is device pixels in every spelling, which is a divergence
//! from upstream recorded as `docs/non-parity.md` 17 and pinned by
//! `impeller-testkit`'s `the_dilation_under_a_scale_reaches_the_same_distance`.
//! `ImageFilter::scaled_by` leaves it alone on purpose: scaling it here while
//! `Layer::scaled_by` does not would trade a stated divergence for an unstated
//! inconsistency. So this file asserts the radii *agree across spellings* without
//! asserting they scale.
//!
//! Recording only, so it needs no device.
