//! What the public API does with data a caller did not sanitize.
//!
//! `impeller-geometry`'s `hostile.rs` covers the path and the tessellator,
//! which is where the geometry arrives. This covers the rest of the front
//! door: the calls that take a caller's *arrays* -- a mesh's positions and
//! indices, an atlas's sprites and source rectangles, a glyph run's placements,
//! a gradient's stops. Those are the arguments most likely to come from a file
//! or a wire rather than from a literal, and each has a shape the renderer
//! relies on.
//!
//! Recording only, with no device. Everything asserted here is decided while
//! building a `Recording`, so the whole file runs anywhere and in a
//! millisecond -- and a defect in it is a defect on every backend rather than
//! on the one that happened to be present.
//!
//! The claim is the same one the geometry file makes and is worth repeating
//! because it is easy to weaken by accident: *garbage in may give garbage out,
//! but it must not give a panic, and it must not give a recording that names
//! something that is not there.* A draw whose vertex indices run off the end
//! of its buffer is not a wrong picture; it is a read the driver performs on
//! this process's behalf.
//!
//! # These passed the first time they were run, which is not evidence
//!
//! All four did, and a property test that has never failed has not been shown
//! to be able to. So the mesh one was checked against the guard it is about:
//! deleting the index bounds check in `Vertices::build` did *not* fail it, and
//! the reason turned out to be worth knowing rather than a flaw. The invariant
//! has two independent guards -- `Vertices` refuses the index, and
//! `Batch::push` refuses it again with its own message -- so removing either
//! leaves the other holding, and the recording stays addressable. Removing
//! both fails the property, on `index 0 against 0 vertices`.
//!
//! That is the shape of thing worth writing down: the property is sound, the
//! codebase is belt-and-braces here, and a mutation that removes one belt
//! proves nothing about the test.

    // deep filter overflowed the stack being freed at the end of the statement that
    // built it. That is a property of a recursively boxed type in the caller's own
    // code -- it happens before the filter is handed to anything here, and no
    // refusal on this side can prevent it. What this file can say is that the
    // renderer refuses what it is given rather than crashing on it, and the
    // refusal costs the limit rather than the filter's own size, because
    // `nests_deeper_than` walks iteratively and stops as soon as the limit is
    // passed.
