//! Choosing a rendering backend at runtime.
//!
//! The backend is selected when a context is created rather than when the
//! binary is built, because one binary frequently has to run on machines with
//! different graphics stacks — an embedded image that boots on a board with a
//! working Vulkan driver and on one where only GLES is usable should not be two
//! builds.
//!
//! That selection is an enumeration rather than a trait object. The HAL trait
//! has associated types, which is what keeps it zero-cost and lets each backend
//! name its own texture and fence, and a trait with associated types cannot be
//! made into an object. Enumerating the compiled-in backends costs one branch
//! per call and keeps the types intact.
