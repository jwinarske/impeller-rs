//! What the validation layer says while a context is being destroyed.
//!
//! Every other Vulkan assertion in this workspace reads the validation log
//! through the context that owns it, which cannot cover the context's own
//! teardown: a child object that outlives its device is reported at
//! `vkDestroyDevice`, and that call is inside the drop. So the reports made
//! there were not merely unchecked, they were unreachable -- and a descriptor
//! set layout leaked on every device for as long as the material set has
//! existed, with the whole suite green.
