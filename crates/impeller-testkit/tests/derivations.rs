//! What the scene model derives about itself, held to the shape of the model.
//!
//! Every check in this file exists because the same mistake has been made four
//! times: a field is added to the scene format, and a derivation that
//! enumerates what it cares about goes on not caring about it. Each time the
//! failure was silent -- a plate reported as covering a feature nothing
//! applied, textures left unbound for a scene that reads them -- and each time
//! it was found by a picture rather than by a test.
//!
//! What is different here is the mechanism. These do not list the fields they
//! expect; they build a value with a full struct literal and no `..default()`,
//! so a new field on the type stops this file compiling until somebody comes
//! here and says which side of the question it falls on. That is the only kind
//! of check that has not already been got past once.
//!
//! `LayerSpec` and not `Item`, and the line is drawn deliberately. A layer's
//! fields are nearly all treatments -- of the group, or of what is behind it --
//! so asking of a new one "is this a feature?" is a question it will usually
//! have an interesting answer to. An item's are mostly geometry, it gains them
//! often, and locking it the same way would stop the build on every field that
//! was never going to be a feature. Three of the four misses were on a layer.

// Reached from helpers rather than test bodies, so clippy's test-code
