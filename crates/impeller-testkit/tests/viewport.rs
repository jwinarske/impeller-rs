//! A layer records its draws before anything is known about how much of the
//! target they cover, and `docs/architecture.md` records that a recording is
//! tessellated geometry rather than a command list — so by the time the extent
//! could be narrowed, every vertex and every material is already in the clip
//! space of the target that was aimed at. Narrowing the *target* instead, and
//! sliding the viewport so the wanted region lands on it, leaves all of that
//! alone. These say the two backends actually do that.
