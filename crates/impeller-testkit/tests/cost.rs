//! What each corpus scene costs to record, as numbers that cannot drift.
//!
//! A frame's cost has two halves and only one of them can be gated here.
//! Wall-clock time needs a quiet machine and a real device, which is what
//! `cargo xtask bench --check` and `tests/bench-baselines/` are for and why
//! they are run by hand on a bench board rather than in CI. What a frame *does*
//! is a different quantity: how many passes it needs, how many draws go in
//! them, how much geometry those draws carry. Those are decided while
//! recording, before any device is involved, so they are the same number on
//! lavapipe and on V3D and on a machine with no GPU at all -- which means they
//! can be recorded once and checked on every commit, at no variance.
//!
//! That is the half that catches an *algorithmic* regression, and most
//! regressions worth catching are algorithmic. A change that stops sharing a
//! backdrop capture, or tessellates a stroke twice as finely, or splits a pass
//! that used to be one, moves these numbers and moves them by the same amount
//! everywhere. A change that costs ten per cent of a millisecond on one driver
//! does not, and no amount of timing in CI would separate it from the noise.
//!
//! # What it does not claim
//!
//! Device-independent is established by construction. Machine-independent is
//! not, and is a weaker claim than it sounds: a vertex count comes from a
//! segment count, which comes from float arithmetic, and while Rust does not
//! contract multiplies and adds behind your back there is no *guarantee* the
//! answer is identical on another architecture.
//!
//! So it was measured rather than argued. This file's baseline was recorded on
//! x86-64 and the same binary's table, cross-built for aarch64 and run on a
//! Raspberry Pi 5, matched it byte for byte on 2026-08-28. One board and one
//! date, which is not a proof and is a great deal better than a paragraph
//! explaining why it ought to hold. If a row ever moves on a board and nowhere
//! else, that is the thing to suspect -- and it is worth knowing rather than
//! worth suppressing.
//!
//! # Why the corpus and not the catalog
//!
//! Fifty-nine rows against nearly three hundred. The corpus is the collection
//! where every scene is there because it exercises something no other scene
//! does, which is the property that makes a moved row mean something; the
//! catalog is broad on purpose and a table of it would be mostly noise in the
//! diff of every commit that adds a plate.
//!
//! # Updating this
//!
//! `UPDATE_COST_BASELINE=1 cargo test -p impeller-testkit --test cost`, and
//! then read the diff: it is the claim that every number that moved was meant
//! to. The same posture the shader snapshots take, for the same reason -- a
//! file that is regenerated without being read is a file that records whatever
//! happened rather than what was intended.

// Reached from a helper rather than from a test body, so clippy's test-code
// exemption does not see it. A failed assumption in a test should stop the
// run; the workspace denies these because a *library* must not.
