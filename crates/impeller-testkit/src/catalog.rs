//! Scenes mirroring the ones Impeller's own playground offers.
//!
//! Impeller's playground is a mode of its test suite: a `TEST_P` that calls
//! `OpenPlaygroundHere` renders a frame, and with the flag set it opens a
//! window instead of running headless. The scenes are therefore its tests,
//! grouped by topic across `aiks_dl_*_unittests.cc` -- basic, blend, blur,
//! clip, gradient, opacity, path, primitive shape, vertices, atlas, shadow,
//! text and runtime effects.
//!
//! This is the same set of pictures, as far as this renderer can draw them.
//! `docs/playground-parity.md` is the inventory: what each file contains, what
//! is reproduced here, and what is blocked and on which missing capability.
//!
//! # Why not the corpus
//!
//! The corpus is deliberately small and varied -- each scene is there because
//! it exercises something no other scene does, and its tolerances are tuned
//! per scene against a software reference. Several hundred pictures organized
//! around somebody else's test suite is a different thing with a different
//! purpose, and folding them together would ruin the property that makes the
//! corpus useful: that a failure in it names a capability rather than a
//! picture.
//!
//! So these are their own collection. They render on both backends and are
//! compared against each other, which is what makes them worth having as
//! tests rather than only as pictures, but they carry no per-scene tolerance
//! and no claim to be minimal.
//!
//! # Naming
//!
//! Every scene is named for the test it mirrors, in the form
//! `topic/CppTestName` reduced to kebab case. A reader who wants to know what
//! a scene is supposed to show can find the original by its name, and a
//! scene here with no counterpart there would be visible as one.
