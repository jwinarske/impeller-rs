//! Presenting through an EGL window surface.
//!
//! # Where the surface comes from
//!
//! A caller brings one, exactly as the Vulkan swapchain target takes a
//! `VkSurfaceKHR`. An application already has a window system connection and a
//! window; turning those into an `EGLSurface` is one call, and owning that
//! relationship would mean owning a windowing library.
//!
//! # Why rendering does not go straight into the window
//!
//! It could, and it would be wrong side up. Everything this renderer draws is
//! oriented so that a framebuffer's row zero holds the image's *top* row: the
//! shader translator negates Y when targeting GLSL, which is what makes reading
//! a target back need no flip and what makes the two backends agree pixel for
//! pixel. A window system reads a framebuffer the other way — row zero is the
//! bottom of what it shows — so handing it that content displays the frame
//! upside down.
//!
//! Rendering into an offscreen target and blitting it to the window with the
//! rows exchanged puts the flip in exactly one place, at the moment the image
//! stops being something this renderer reads and becomes something a window
//! system does. The alternative is a second orientation convention threaded
//! through the projection, the scissor, the stencil and the readback, each of
//! which then behaves differently depending on where the frame is going.
//!
//! The cost is one full-screen blit per frame. That is what an offscreen-then-
//! present design costs anywhere, and a multisampled frame is already paying it
//! for the resolve.
//!
//! # What the tests can and cannot see
//!
//! An EGL pbuffer is a surface with no window behind it, so surface creation,
//! making it current, the blit and the buffer swap all run with no display
//! present. What no test here can observe is what a window system would
//! actually put on screen. So the property checked is the one that decides it:
//! a presented frame must be the vertical mirror of the frame as rendered.
