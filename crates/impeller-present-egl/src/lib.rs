/// The EGL counterpart of a headless Vulkan surface: everything a window
/// surface does — being made current, being blitted into, being swapped —
/// happens the same way, and nothing is displayed. What it cannot show is what
/// a window system would put on screen, which is why the presentation target
/// states its orientation as a relationship between two images rather than as
/// an appearance.
///
/// Offered here rather than confined to a test for the same reason the Vulkan
/// one is: a conformance run, a soak test, and a developer on a headless box
/// all want it, and each would otherwise write it themselves.
///
/// The surface is the caller's to destroy, with [`destroy_surface`], after the
/// target built on it has been destroyed.
