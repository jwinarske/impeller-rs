//! How a draw combines with what a target already holds.
//!
//! Two families live here, and they differ in kind rather than degree.
//!
//! The Porter-Duff modes decide *where* each side survives, and are expressible
//! with fixed-function blend factors: they work on every device with no
//! extension and no capability gate, which is why they came first. A renderer
//! unable to composite without an extension would be unusable on the hardware
//! least likely to have one.
//!
//! The separable modes — multiply, screen, overlay and the rest — mix the two
//! sides *arithmetically*, channel by channel. No combination of blend factors
//! expresses that, so they need an advanced-blend extension and are
//! capability-gated. Their formulas are fixed by the specification, which is
//! what makes them testable against a computed expectation rather than against
//! a recorded picture.
//!
//! The non-separable modes — hue, saturation, color and luminosity — need the
//! same extension and differ again in kind: each output channel depends on all
//! three input channels, because they are stated in terms of a color's hue,
//! saturation and luminosity rather than of its components. They are checked
//! against what they are named for rather than against values: whether hue kept
//! the backdrop's luminosity, whether saturation took the source's.
//!
//! Every mode assumes **premultiplied** color, which is what the render target
//! holds. The factors differ from the straight-alpha forms: source-over is
//! `ONE` rather than `SRC_ALPHA`, because the source has already been scaled.
