/// The obvious encoding gives each clip a bit, which caps nesting at eight and
/// makes intersecting two clips a per-bit affair. Storing the *nesting depth*
/// instead lets a clip stack of any size fit in the same eight bits, and makes
/// the test a single comparison: content belongs to depth `d` and draws where
/// the stencil holds `d`, which is true only where every clip down to that
/// depth admitted the pixel.
///
/// It also makes undoing a clip a local operation. Because a stack unwinds in
/// the order it was built, no pixel can hold more than the depth being left, so
/// stepping back is a decrement rather than a recomputation from the remaining
/// clips.
