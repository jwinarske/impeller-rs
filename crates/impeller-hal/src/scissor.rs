//! The rectangle a draw is confined to, in device pixels.
//!
//! # Why a rectangle and not a clip
//!
//! This is deliberately not called a clip. A clip in a drawing API is whatever
//! region a caller asked for — a rounded rectangle, an arbitrary path, several
//! of those intersected — and only some of those are rectangles. This type is
//! the part every device implements directly and exactly, at no cost, through
//! the same fixed-function unit in both APIs. Naming it for what it is keeps
//! the eventual stencil-backed clip from having to pretend to be one of these.
//!
//! It is also not a stepping stone that a stencil implementation would replace.
//! An axis-aligned clip should keep using this even once arbitrary clips work,
//! because a scissor is exact and free where a stencil pass is neither.
//!
//! # Orientation
//!
//! `y` is measured **downward from the top** of the target, matching the row
//! order that reading a texture back produces.
//!
//! Neither backend converts, which is worth stating because it is the opposite
//! of what the two APIs' documented conventions suggest. OpenGL numbers window
//! rows upward from the bottom, so a conversion looks obligatory. It is not:
//! the shader translator already negates Y when targeting GLSL, so geometry
//! lands in the GL framebuffer with its top row at GL's y of zero. That is the
//! same cancellation that makes reading a target back need no row flip, and a
//! scissor converted "correctly" mirrors the clip vertically for exactly the
//! same reason an added row flip mirrors the image.
//!
//! The convention has to be fixed here rather than left to each backend,
//! because a scissor is invisible in any target symmetric about its horizontal
//! center line: a backend that got this wrong would pass every test whose clip
//! did not sit deliberately off-center.
