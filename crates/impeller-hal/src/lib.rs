//! Rendering HAL trait: the backend-agnostic contract every rendering backend
//! implements.
//!
//! The HAL answers how draw commands become pixels in a GPU image.
//! Presentation — how a finished image reaches a display, and how the frame
//! loop is paced — is a separate, orthogonal axis and lives in
//! `impeller-present`.
//!
//! # Shape of the trait
//!
//! Deliberately Vulkan-leaning. Recording commands and replaying them as GL
//! calls works; extracting Vulkan-grade explicitness from an immediate-mode
//! abstraction does not. GLES pays a small CPU cost for command recording, and
//! that is the accepted trade. The trait is never reduced to a lowest common
//! denominator to accommodate a weaker backend: backends implement, emulate,
//! or capability-gate.
//!
//! # Two requirements present from day one
//!
//! Both exist for the sake of the DRM presentation path, and both are here
//! before any DRM code, because retrofitting either is a breaking redesign:
//!
//! 1. **External render targets** — [`ExternalImageDesc`] lets the renderer
//!    draw into images it did not allocate, carrying dma-buf fd, DRM fourcc,
//!    and format modifier.
//! 2. **Exportable sync** — [`HalFence::export_sync_file`] converts GPU
//!    completion into a `sync_file` fd that can ride an atomic commit as
//!    `IN_FENCE_FD`.
//!
//! # Branch on capabilities, never on backend identity
//!
//! [`Capabilities`] is the only thing layers above the HAL are allowed to
//! condition on. A Mali GPU lacking fence export and a desktop Vulkan driver
//! lacking `VK_KHR_external_fence_fd` are the same problem, and code asking
//! "is this GLES?" instead of "can this export a fence?" gets both wrong.

/// Building a real backend showed that to be the wrong seam. What a backend
/// actually wants is the whole [`Batch`] at once, because the useful decisions
/// are all global to it: which draws can share a pipeline binding, how to lay
/// out one shared vertex buffer, what to upload in a single copy. Handing over
/// a stream of calls forces each backend to reconstruct that shape, and a
/// record-and-replay backend would have to buffer the stream anyway just to see
/// what it was given.
///
/// This stays explicit in the sense that matters — nothing is discovered at
/// draw time and the caller states its whole intent up front — while leaving
/// each backend free to realize it natively.

/// creation from several threads at once. The intended design is thread-safe
/// creation behind `&self`, which needs interior mutability around the
/// allocator. That is deferred rather than decided against: nothing creates
