//! Vulkan backend via ash. First-class: the reference implementation, the
//! conformance oracle other backends are diffed against, and where new
//! features land first.
//!
//! Vulkan 1.1 is the floor; later features are used when present rather than
//! required. Features avoided for MoltenVK compatibility — geometry shaders,
//! tessellation shaders, sparse residency, multi-draw-indirect-with-count —
//! are none of them needed for 2D.
//!
//! Implements the `Hal` and `HalContext` traits, so the renderer and the
//! conformance harness can drive this backend without naming it. The concrete
//! API stays available alongside for bring-up and for tests that need Vulkan
//! specifics.
