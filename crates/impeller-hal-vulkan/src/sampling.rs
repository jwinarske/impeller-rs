//! Texture bindings for the image paint.
//!
//! # Why every draw binds a texture
//!
//! The shader is one program serving every material kind, so it declares the
//! texture and sampler whether a given draw samples them or not. Vulkan wants
//! every descriptor a pipeline statically uses to be bound, and "statically
//! uses" does not care that the branch reading it is unreachable for a solid
//! fill. The alternatives are a pipeline variant per material kind, which
//! multiplies the cache by four to avoid one binding, or leaving the descriptor
//! unbound, which is invalid. So a draw that samples nothing binds a one-pixel
//! placeholder instead.
//!
//! # Why one sampler rather than one per tile mode
//!
//! Address modes are a property of the paint, and baking them into samplers
//! would mean a sampler per combination and a descriptor set per draw that used
//! a different one. The shader does the wrapping arithmetic itself and the
//! sampler stays fixed at clamp-to-edge, which also keeps repeat and decal from
//! depending on filtering behavior at the seam.
