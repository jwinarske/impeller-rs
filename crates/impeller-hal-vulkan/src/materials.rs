//! Where a draw's paint lives on the way to the shader.
//!
//! # Why a uniform buffer rather than push constants
//!
//! Push constants were the obvious home: a material is small, they need no
//! allocation, and every device guarantees 128 bytes of them. That guarantee
//! is also the ceiling, and a material had grown to occupy it exactly -- so
//! the mechanism decided what a paint could hold, which is the wrong way round.
//! A color filter has to sit on top of whatever material is already there, and
//! a color matrix alone is twenty floats; neither fits beside a four-stop
//! gradient under any arrangement.
//!
//! The concern with moving was the hardware this targets: push constants are
//! the cheap path for small per-draw data on tile-based parts, and a
//! guaranteed minimum exists because parts that offer only the minimum are
//! exactly those. Impeller's own renderer settles it -- it places per-draw
//! uniform data in a per-frame host buffer, aligned to the backend's minimum
//! uniform offset, on the same class of hardware. A uniform buffer with a
//! dynamic offset per draw is what that is.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! One buffer per submission holding every draw's material end to end, each
//! padded to the device's minimum offset alignment, and one descriptor set
//! bound with a different dynamic offset per draw. The alternative -- a
//! descriptor set per draw -- would allocate in proportion to the batch and
//! rebind a set where rebinding an offset does.
//!
//! It is a second descriptor set rather than another binding in the texture
//! set, because the texture set includes a placeholder owned by the context
//! and outliving any one submission. Adding a per-submission buffer to it
//! would mean rewriting a long-lived set while an earlier submission might
//! still be reading it.
