//! Fences, and handing GPU completion to something outside this process.
//!
//! This is the second of the two requirements the HAL reserved from day one.
//! The DRM presentation path attaches the render-done fence to an atomic commit
//! as `IN_FENCE_FD`, so the kernel latches the page flip when rendering
//! finishes rather than the CPU waiting first and then committing. Losing that
//! costs a full frame of latency and puts a block in the middle of the frame
//! loop, which is exactly what explicit sync exists to avoid.
//!
//! Export comes from a semaphore rather than from the fence, and that is not a
//! stylistic choice. Exporting a `SYNC_FD` payload uses copy transference,
//! which resets the object it came from: a fence exported this way returns to
//! the unsignalled state with no pending work, so a later wait on it blocks
//! forever. Signalling both a fence and a semaphore from one submission keeps
//! the two jobs separate — the semaphore's payload is handed to the kernel, and
//! the fence stays intact for deciding when the submission's resources can be
//! released.
//!
//! Either way the object must be created exportable. Vulkan offers no way to
//! make one exportable after the fact, the same as for an exportable image.
