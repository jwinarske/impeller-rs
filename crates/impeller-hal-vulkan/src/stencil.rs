//! The transient stencil attachment clipping is built on.
//!
//! Allocated per submission rather than cached, matching the multisample
//! buffer: both are written during a pass and never read again, and both will
//! move into the frame's resource pool once one exists. Caching either now
//! would mean writing invalidation rules before anything needs them.
//!
//! # Why not a `VulkanTexture`
//!
//! Every other image in this backend goes through `create_texture`, which is
//! keyed by [`impeller_hal::PixelFormat`]. A stencil format is not one of
//! those and should not become one: `PixelFormat` describes what a caller can
//! render into and read back, and nothing above the HAL can do either with a
//! stencil buffer. Widening it to carry a format only this file allocates would
//! put a variant every backend must handle into the public surface.
