//! Packing rasterized glyph coverage into one texture.
//!
//! # What this does and does not do
//!
//! It takes coverage bitmaps and answers where in a texture each one sits. It
//! does not rasterize them: turning an outline into coverage needs a font
//! parser, and font parsing is out of scope here — bring `swash` or
//! `ttf-parser` and hand the result over. That boundary is what lets the atlas
//! be tested with no font anywhere in the tree, against bitmaps whose contents
//! are known exactly.
//!
//! # Shelf packing
//!
//! Glyphs are packed into horizontal shelves: a new glyph goes on the first
//! shelf tall enough for it with room to its right, and starts a new shelf
//! otherwise. That wastes the space above short glyphs on a tall shelf, which
//! a skyline or a max-rects packer would recover.
//!
//! It is the right trade for glyphs specifically. A run of text is a stream of
//! boxes of very similar height, so shelves fill densely in practice, and the
//! packer runs once per glyph per size rather than per frame. A packer with
//! better worst-case density would cost more per insertion and more to read for
//! a gain that the input's own shape mostly removes.
//!
//! # Making room
//!
//! Shelves cannot free a glyph in place: a hole in the middle of one is not
//! reusable by anything but a glyph of the same height, and tracking holes is
//! most of what makes a general packer expensive. So room is made by compacting
//! — keeping the glyphs this frame has asked for, discarding the rest, and
//! repacking from scratch.
//!
//! That is a heavier operation than freeing one entry and a much simpler one to
//! be sure of, and its cost is bounded by how often it can happen: it runs only
//! when an insertion would otherwise fail, and it cannot run twice in a frame
//! without the second one failing outright, because everything left after the
//! first is something this frame needs. Text that genuinely needs more than an
//! atlas holds is a case for a second page, not for a cleverer packer.
