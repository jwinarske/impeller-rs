//! A GPU fence for the GLES backend, built on `EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync`.
//!
//! This backend had no fence at all until now: `Hal::Fence` was
//! `std::convert::Infallible`, so one could not be constructed, and
//! `SyncSupport` reported false whatever EGL advertised. That was honest but
//! it closed two doors at once — a caller could not wait on GPU completion,
//! and a display path could not obtain the `IN_FENCE_FD` an atomic commit
//! wants, so `execute_deferred` was unavailable on this backend entirely.
//!
//! What makes it a *native* fence rather than an EGL-internal one is the
//! attribute at creation: with `EGL_SYNC_NATIVE_FENCE_ANDROID` the object can
//! be dup'd out as a `sync_file` descriptor and handed to something outside
//! this process, which is the whole reason a scanout ring needs it. An
//! `EGL_KHR_fence_sync` object cannot leave, so it is not enough here even
//! though it would serve the two waits.
