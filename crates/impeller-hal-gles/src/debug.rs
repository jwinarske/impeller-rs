//! Capturing driver diagnostics so tests can assert on them.
//!
//! The counterpart of the Vulkan backend's validation log, and here for the
//! same reason: a diagnostic that only reaches stderr is noticed when somebody
//! happens to look, and code that misuses the API can pass an entire suite
//! while appearing to work.
//!
//! What is available differs from Vulkan in kind. There is no layer to load —
//! `GL_KHR_debug` is the driver reporting on itself, which every GLES 3.2
//! implementation offers and Mesa implements well. It reports API errors,
//! undefined behavior, and portability problems, which is narrower than a
//! validation layer: it does not track object lifetimes or synchronization.
//! What it does cover is exactly what this backend is most likely to get
//! wrong, since GLES is a state machine and most mistakes here are a call made
//! with the wrong state bound.
//!
//! Messages are requested synchronously, so one arrives inside the call that
//! caused it rather than at some later flush. That costs time, which is why it
//! is off unless asked for, and it is what makes a captured message point at
//! the code responsible.
