//! Generated format and modifier sets, put through negotiation.
//!
//! Negotiation is where two independently-reported lists of what hardware can do
//! meet, and agreeing a layout neither side advertised is the failure with
//! consequences: the renderer allocates one thing, the display scans out
//! another, and what reaches a panel is skewed or nothing. The table of cases in
//! `negotiate.rs` covers the shapes someone thought of, including both refusal
//! paths. These cover the shapes nobody did.
//!
//! `proptest` rather than a fuzzer, for the reason `docs/architecture.md` gives
//! where it rejects `cargo-fuzz`: no nightly and no C toolchain, and a property
//! that runs in the gate beats one that runs somewhere else.
//!
//! # The alphabet is small on purpose
//!
//! Generating fourccs and modifiers from the whole of `u32` and `u64` would make
//! two sides sharing anything vanishingly rare, so every case would take the
//! refusal path and the properties about a successful agreement would never run
//! -- passing while testing nothing, which is the trap this repository has
//! written down twice. So both sides draw from a handful of values, which makes
//! collisions the common case. `agreement_and_refusal_both_happen` is what keeps
//! that claim honest rather than assumed.
//!
//! # One guard these cannot reach
//!
//! `FormatModifierSet::intersect` refuses two sets whose fourccs differ, and
//! removing that refusal leaves every property here passing. That is correct
//! rather than a hole: `negotiate` only ever intersects sets it has already
//! selected by the same fourcc, so the guard is unreachable through this API and
//! is pinned where it is reachable, by `intersection_fails_loudly_rather_than_falling_back`
//! in `impeller-hal`. Worth stating, because a reader who found that mutation
//! surviving would otherwise conclude these properties were weaker than they are.
