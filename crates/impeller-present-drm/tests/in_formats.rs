//! Generated `IN_FORMATS` blobs, which is the one place here that reads the
//! kernel's bytes at offsets it computes itself.
//!
//! The table of cases beside `parse_in_formats` pins what a correct blob means:
//! bit zero of a mask is the format at that entry's offset, a format nothing
//! claims drops out, a repeated modifier is listed once. Those say the parser
//! reads a *well-formed* blob correctly. What they cannot say is that no
//! malformed one gets it to index outside what it was given, because a table
//! only holds the malformations someone thought of.
//!
//! So this generates them. `proptest` rather than a fuzzer for the reason
//! `docs/architecture.md` gives: this workspace compiles with no C toolchain and
//! no nightly, and a property runs in the gate on every commit instead of
//! somewhere else on a schedule.
//!
//! # Why these are not fed random bytes
//!
//! Almost every byte string fails at the version word -- a `u32` that has to
//! equal one -- so a generator over `Vec<u8>` would spend its whole run
//! returning at the second guard, and pass having exercised nothing past it.
//! That is the trap `a_skip_says_the_word_the_census_counts` exists for in
//! another form: a check that reads nothing passes everything. These build a
//! structurally plausible blob and then corrupt it, so the arithmetic under test
//! is actually reached. `a_generated_blob_is_usually_read_rather_than_refused`
//! is what holds that honest.
//!
//! # What is asserted, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! The properties here are *containment* claims: nothing comes out that did not
//! go in. They do not recompute which format a mask ought to claim, because a
//! reference implementation of that would be the same arithmetic twice and would
//! agree with the parser about any mistake in it. Attribution is pinned by the
//! hand-written table instead. The division is deliberate: the table catches the
//! right modifier on the wrong format, and these catch a value from nowhere.
