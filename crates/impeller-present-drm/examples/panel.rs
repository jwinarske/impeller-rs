//! Draw a moving scene straight to a panel, with no compositor.
//!
//! The tests beside this one prove the path works by pushing solid quads at it
//! and reading counters. That is the right shape for a test and shows nothing:
//! the point of direct scanout is that a picture reaches a display, and nobody
//! has been able to look at one until there was a board to look at.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p impeller-present-drm --example panel
//! IMPELLER_DRM_CARD=/dev/dri/card1 SECONDS=30 cargo run ... --example panel
//! ```
//!
//! It takes DRM master, so nothing else may be driving the display -- on a
//! Raspberry Pi that means stopping the compositor, or never starting one.
//! `cargo xtask drm` says whether this machine can.
//!
//! `IMPELLER_DRM_CARD` matters on a board with more than one display
//! controller. A Raspberry Pi 5 has two, and only one of them can currently
//! scan out what this renderer exports; without naming a card you get whichever
//! `/dev/dri` lists first. The crate documentation has the table.
//!
//! # Reading the report
//!
//! It ends with what it paced: frames presented, the vertical blanks that passed
//! while it did, and how many of those blanks the display latched nothing new on.
//! The last is the number worth having, and it is counted from the sequence the
//! kernel reports with each flip rather than from a clock. `crate::pacing` says
//! why.
//!
//! Three things that number is not. It is not a property of the renderer alone --
//! a deeper ring hides a slow frame instead of missing a blank, so the ring depth
//! is printed beside it. It is not comparable with `cargo xtask bench`'s
//! `full frame, mixed content` row, which is a different scene at a different size
//! and counts neither the recording nor the present. And it means little from a
//! debug build: **build this release** and run it from a filesystem the numbers
//! were taken on, which for this project's board means
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build -p impeller-present-drm --release --example panel
//! scp target/.../examples/panel board:/tmp/
//! ssh board 'cd /tmp && IMPELLER_DRM_CARD=/dev/dri/card0 ./panel'
//! ```
//!
//! `docs/on-a-board.md` has the cross-compilation recipe and the preconditions a
//! number taken here has to state.
//!
//! `DEPTH=n` sets the ring depth, and two is the interesting value. A three-deep
//! ring can absorb a frame that overran its period by holding a finished buffer
//! back, so a run that misses nothing at three has kept up without saying whether it
//! had room to spare. A two-deep ring has nowhere to put that frame, so the same
//! result at two is the stronger claim.
//!
//! Two knobs exist to make the miss count say something rather than read zero.
//! `CARDS=n` scales the scene, since a counter that has only ever read zero is not
//! known to work. `STALL=n` makes every nth frame late by two frame periods, and
//! should cost one missed blank each time -- so `STALL=10` over a hundred and
//! sixty-five frames gives sixteen, which is what it gave when this was calibrated.
//!
//! Two periods rather than one, and the reason is worth knowing before reading any
//! number here. This loop already waits for the flip it committed before committing
//! again, so on a scene the renderer finishes early there is a whole period of slack
//! in every frame. Sleeping one period spends that slack and misses nothing --
//! measured, at `STALL=2`, which held sixty frames a second and zero misses. Only
//! the second period overruns the blank. A frame being late is not the same as a
//! frame being late *enough*, and a miss count is the difference.
