//! The display-side surface this crate requires.
//!
//! Everything to do with KMS — connector and plane discovery, mode selection,
//! atomic commit construction, page-flip events, framebuffer import — belongs
//! to the KMS binding. This crate reimplements none of it, and the dependency
//! runs one way: the binding knows nothing about rendering.
//!
//! That surface is expressed here as a trait rather than consumed directly, for
//! two reasons. It states what a binding must provide, so the two projects can
//! be sequenced against each other rather than discovering the mismatch at
//! integration. And it makes the frame loop testable without a display: the
//! parts most worth testing are the ring accounting and the fence plumbing,
//! neither of which needs real hardware to get wrong.
//!
//! "A binding" rather than the one in use, because a second is expected and the
//! first has no special claim. drm-rs implements this today, in `kms.rs` and
//! `device.rs`, and those two files are the only ones in the crate permitted to
//! name it — this file, the frame loop, and the types below name nothing from
//! it, which is what makes replacing it a matter of writing another
//! implementation rather than editing this one. A test enforces that, because
//! a single convenient import would end it silently.
