//! Baking a gradient's stops into a texture the shader can sample.
//!
//! # Why a texture at all
//!
//! The material carries a fixed, small number of stops in push constants, which
//! covers the overwhelming majority of real gradients and nothing beyond them.
//! A gradient with more used to be truncated, silently; then it was refused,
//! honestly. This is the third answer: evaluate the ramp once on the way in and
//! hand the shader an image of it, so the count stops mattering.
//!
//! # Why linear half-floats, and why straight alpha
//!
//! The table is stored the way the walk produced it: linear, unclamped, four
//! half-floats a texel.
//!
//! It was stored through an sRGB format, and for a good reason — eight bits of
//! *linear* color band visibly in the darks, the eye's resolution not being
//! uniform across the range, so spacing those eight bits by the transfer
//! function spent them where they could be seen. That argument is *answered*
//! rather than overridden. Half has no fixed quantum; its precision is
//! relative, about eleven bits of mantissa at every magnitude, so there are no
//! longer eight bits to spend well and the perceptual spacing was buying what
//! the format now gives everywhere.
//!
//! What the old format could not do at all was hold a component outside the
//! sRGB primaries, and the invariant below quietly depended on never being
//! asked to.
//!
//! The color is stored straight rather than premultiplied, and the reason for
//! that changed with the format. It used to be that a transfer function does
//! not commute with multiplying by alpha, so the multiply had to happen after
//! the decode. A linear table has no decode. The reason that survives is the
//! convergence: the shader premultiplies stops read from push constants at the
//! very end, so a premultiplied table would fork the two paths at exactly the
//! point this design exists to join them.
