//! Cutting a path into the pieces a dash pattern leaves behind.
//!
//! # Why this is a path transform rather than a stroke option
//!
//! A dashed stroke is a stroke of a different path. Cutting first and stroking
//! the pieces gives every dash its own caps and gives the joins that survive
//! the cut the same treatment they would have had, which is what a reader
//! expects and what SVG and PostScript specify. The alternative — teaching the
//! stroker to skip — would have to decide what a join means when one of its two
//! segments is not drawn, and there is no answer to that which is not simply
//! this one arrived at more expensively.
//!
//! It also means dashing composes with everything already here for free: the
//! result is a path, so it tessellates, transforms, clips and antialiases by
//! the same code as any other.
//!
//! # What a pattern means
//!
//! Lengths alternate drawn and skipped, starting drawn, and repeat. An odd
//! number of them repeats to an even one, so `[5]` is five on and five off —
//! the SVG rule, and the one that makes a single number mean something obvious
//! rather than nothing. The phase advances the starting position into the
//! pattern, which is how a marching-ants animation is made without rebuilding
//! anything.
//!
//! Measurement is along the flattened path, so a dash on a curve is as accurate
//! as the flattening tolerance makes it. That is the same accuracy the stroke
//! itself has, so a dash cannot be more wrong than the line it lies on.
