//! Flutter's rounded superellipse -- the iOS-style squircle.
//!
//! A corner here is not one curve. It is a superellipse arc that leaves the
//! flat side, a circular arc through the diagonal, and a second superellipse
//! arc back onto the next side, joined so the tangents agree. The
//! superellipse's degree is not a constant either: it is read from a fitted
//! table on the ratio of side to corner radius, so a shallow corner and a deep
//! one are different curves rather than the same curve scaled.
//!
//! **None of that is derivable.** The table was fitted upstream by search, and
//! the only thing that makes it safe to transcribe is that upstream also
//! publishes points on the resulting boundary. Those are transcribed beside it
//! in the tests, which is what turns "these twenty-two numbers were copied
//! correctly" from an assertion into a check: a wrong degree or a misplaced
//! join moves the joint points off the boundary by more than the two
//! hundredths of a unit the assertions allow.
//!
//! Read [`docs/parity.md`] on why this went unbuilt for so long. The short
//! version is that the reason recorded there -- that nothing here could check
//! a transcription -- was wrong, and checking it was the whole job.
