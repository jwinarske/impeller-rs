//! What the geometry does when it is handed numbers nobody meant.
//!
//! [`property.rs`](property.rs) checks the invariants the tessellator relies
//! on over coordinates a real viewport might see, and says in its own header
//! that the degenerate cases are deliberately kept out of it. This is those
//! cases, generated rather than chosen: NaN, both infinities, subnormals, the
//! largest finite float, and structures no caller would write on purpose --
//! subpaths that never move, closes with nothing to close, curves whose
//! control points coincide, thousands of verbs in a row.
//!
//! The claim is not that any of it draws something sensible. Garbage in is
//! allowed to give garbage out. The claim is narrower and is the one that
//! matters to a caller who does not control the data:
//!
//! - it returns rather than panicking, and
//! - the buffers it returns are addressable.
//!
//! The second is the one with teeth. A vertex buffer's indices are handed
//! straight to the GPU and used to index the vertex array, so an index past
//! the end of it is not a wrong picture -- it is a read the driver performs on
//! this process's behalf out of whatever follows the buffer.
//!
//! # Why this and not `cargo-fuzz`
//!
//! libFuzzer needs a nightly toolchain and an LLVM runtime, and this workspace
//! must compile from pure Rust with no C toolchain -- a requirement
//! `deny.toml` bans two crates to protect and `xtask/tests/dependencies.rs`
//! enforces without needing anything installed. A fuzz target would have to
//! sit outside the workspace and run on a toolchain nothing else here uses.
//! `proptest` is already a dependency, shrinks a failure to its smallest form,
//! and runs in the ordinary gate on every commit, which is worth more than
//! coverage-guided depth for input this shallow.
