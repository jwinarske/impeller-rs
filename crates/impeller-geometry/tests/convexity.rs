//! Convexity, checked against the definition it is an optimization of.
//!
//! Classifying a polygon convex lets the tessellator fan-fill it, which skips
//! the sweep entirely -- and applies no fill rule, since a fan has no notion of
//! one. So a wrong `Convex` is not a missed optimization but a silently wrong
//! picture: a self-crossing path filled as though it did not cross, with its
//! fill rule discarded. That is what this guards.
//!
//! The shipped classifier counts quadrant advances, which is exact and cheap.
//! The definition it implements is the total turning angle, which is neither.
//! Both are here and the two are required to agree, so the cheap one can be
//! changed with something to check it against.
