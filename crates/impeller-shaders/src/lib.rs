//! One WGSL source tree is the single source of truth. `build.rs` runs naga
//! over it to produce SPIR-V for Vulkan, and can emit GLSL, MSL, and HLSL for
//! backends that do not exist yet, from the same source and with no C++ shader
//! toolchain anywhere in the build.
//!
//! Translation happens at build time, so nothing here parses shaders at
//! runtime and no shader compiler ships in the binary. That is what makes
//! "all pipelines compiled ahead of time, no compilation jank" achievable
//! rather than aspirational.
