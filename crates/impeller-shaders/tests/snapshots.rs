//! One WGSL source produces the code both backends actually run, and naga
//! produces it. A naga upgrade that changes its output changes what every
//! fragment executes, and nothing else here would say so: the pixels are
//! compared against another implementation of the same translator, so a
//! codegen change that is wrong in the same way on both targets passes every
//! comparison in this workspace. That is the case a snapshot is for.
//!
//! It is not a golden image and makes no claim about correctness. It says the
//! generated code is what it was, so a change to it is something somebody
//! decided rather than something that arrived with a dependency bump.
//!
//! Set `UPDATE_SHADER_SNAPSHOTS=1` to rewrite them, which is the reviewed
//! event: the diff is the thing to look at. Set `IMPELLER_SHADER_SNAPSHOTS`
//! to say where they are, which a cross-built binary on a board has to.
