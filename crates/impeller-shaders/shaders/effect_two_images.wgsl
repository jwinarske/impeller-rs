// A caller's program that samples two textures, standing in for one in the tests.
//
// One texture was the case the shared descriptor set already covered, since
// every draw binds one at the binding this renderer's own shader declares. Two
// is the case that needed the layout to grow: the extra images are further
// bindings in the same set rather than a set of their own, which is what keeps
// one layout serving every pipeline.
//
// Deliberately combines them with an operation neither texture could produce
// alone -- the difference of the two -- so a picture drawn with the same
// texture bound twice, or with the second binding left at the placeholder, is
// not the picture this makes.
