//! Presenting through a `VkSwapchainKHR`.
//!
//! # Where the surface comes from
//!
//! A caller brings one. Creating windows is no more this project's business
//! than mode setting is: an application already has a window system connection
//! and a window, and asking it for the surface those imply is one call, where
//! owning that relationship would mean owning a windowing library.
//!
//! That boundary is also what makes this testable. `VK_EXT_headless_surface`
//! produces a surface with no window behind it, so the whole path — capability
//! query, format negotiation, present mode selection, acquire, present, and
//! recreation on resize — runs on a machine with no display, and every test
//! here does exactly that.
//!
//! # Synchronization
//!
//! Acquisition signals a semaphore, rendering waits on it and signals another,
//! and presentation waits on that. All three orderings are device-side: no
//! thread blocks to enforce any of them, which is the point — a CPU wait
//! between acquiring and drawing costs a frame of latency every frame.
//!
//! One CPU wait remains, and it is the one that should. Before reusing a
//! frame's semaphores and command resources, the frame that last used them has
//! to have finished. Waiting on that is what bounds how far ahead of the
//! display the renderer may run; without it the queue grows without limit and
//! latency with it. It normally does not block at all, because the frame being
//! waited on is two frames old.
//!
//! Two semaphores per frame is not enough, and this is the detail worth being
//! careful about. The render-finished semaphore must be per *image* rather than
//! per frame slot, because presentation waits on it and the engine decides when
//! it is done with an image — reusing one while a present still refers to it is
//! a wait on a payload that has already been consumed.
