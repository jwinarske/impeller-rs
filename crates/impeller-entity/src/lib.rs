//! Entity and Contents layer: backend-agnostic description of what to draw.
//! An Entity carries a transform, blend, clip depth, contents, and geometry.
//!
//! What is built here is coverage, and only coverage. The canvas above already
//! records into a batch directly and does not route through this layer, so
//! anything else would be shaped around a guess about a caller that does not
//! exist yet. Coverage is the exception because it is not a guess: the canvas
//! computes it today in four scattered places -- bounds expanded by a stroke,
//! a layer's outward reach, what a mask blur covers, and the device bounds a
//! save layer is sized to -- and every one of them is this same composition
//! done by hand. Writing it once, with the rules stated and tested, is
//! worthwhile whether or not the rest of the layer is ever built.
//!
//! The composition, in order: geometry bounds in the entity's own coordinates,
//! carried through the transform into device coordinates, grown by however far
//! the contents reach outward, and finally narrowed by the clip. The order
//! matters at both ends. A filter reaches in device pixels rather than in the
//! entity's units, so growing before the transform would scale the reach along
//! with the shape. And the clip narrows last because it is the only step that
//! can make coverage empty for a reason other than the shape being empty.
