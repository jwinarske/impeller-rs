//! The measurement `docs/architecture.md` asks for and could not make.
//!
//! One number in that document decides a design: at 1920x1080 with a hundred
//! and sixty rounded rectangles, the analytic distance field at one sample was
//! measured at 0.26 ms against 0.64 ms for the same shapes tessellated at four
//! and 0.20 ms tessellated at one -- from which "the whole of the gain is in
//! not multisampling", and from which the field is *slower* than the triangles
//! it replaces at equal sample count. The document then says the balance is
//! hardware-dependent in the direction this project cares about, and that it
//! "should be measured on a board before the field is assumed to be the faster
//! path everywhere".
//!
//! Nothing in the tree could make that measurement. This can.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! Not a regression gate *by default*, and the distinction is the whole of the
//! design. A plain run prints numbers and returns success whatever they say,
//! because a threshold nobody has calibrated on a machine nobody has
//! characterized is a build failure waiting to happen on a busy laptop.
//!
//! `--record <path>` writes what a run measured, keyed by device and
//! configuration; `--check <path>` measures again and compares, reporting every
//! row and exiting non-zero if any is slower than `--tolerance` (one percent by
//! default) or if either side has a row the other lacks. Both are opt-in, so
//! the objection above still holds for every run that did not ask for one.
//!
//! The default tolerance is measured rather than chosen, and so is the reason
//! it is not one number for every row. On a Raspberry Pi 5's V3D, seven of the
//! eight rows repeat to within three tenths of a percent across thirty-one
//! runs. The eighth -- the Vulkan distance-field figure -- lands in one of two
//! states three percent apart from one process to the next, because recording
//! a command costs differently in each; `docs/on-a-board.md` has the numbers.
//!
//! A single tolerance has to be as loose as the worst row it covers, so that
//! one row set the bar for all eight and a three percent regression on any of
//! the other seven passed unremarked. A baseline row may therefore carry its
//! own tolerance as an optional fourth field, which puts the slack on the row
//! that needs it, next to the measurement that justifies it, and lets the
//! default be tight enough to mean something.
//!
//! This does not make a busy machine a quiet one. Checking an unchanged build
//! against its own baseline on the workstation this was written on reported
//! three of eight rows regressed, one of them by twelve percent. The test-lane
//! table still records gating as belonging to nightly runs on quiet runners;
//! what has changed is that the machinery now exists for one.
//!
//! Not a comparison against the numbers above either. Those were taken on a
//! desktop discrete part; a run here measures whatever this machine is, which
//! is why every result names its device.
//!
//! The device rows are not a whole frame's work: each recording is built once,
//! before the clock starts, and only `execute` is timed. An application records
//! a frame per frame, so what it costs to *build* one used to be invisible to
//! every number this printed -- named as a blind spot, with its size guessed at
//! from two hand measurements and left outside.
//!
//! It is measured now, as the `recording` section, and the guess was the wrong
//! shape rather than the wrong size. Two of the six builds are indeed under a
//! per cent of their draw: a frame of mixed content builds in 0.006 ms against
//! 14 to draw. But a *stroked* path builds in 0.240 ms and draws in 1.2, which
//! is a fifth of the cost on the side nothing was watching -- and it is the
//! cheapest row in the file to draw, so timing only the drawing made the
//! stroker look free. The two sections add, since a frame pays for both.
//!
//! That section needs no device, which is why it comes first and why it is
//! measured even where every backend was skipped. A `Canvas` opens nothing.
//!
//! It is also the one part of this file with a check that runs everywhere.
//! Absolute milliseconds need a board and a baseline, so they catch a regression
//! only when someone benches; a *ratio* of one build to another cancels the
//! processor and holds on any machine --  measured at 3.20 on a Ryzen 9 at 5.3 GHz
//! and 3.07 on an A76 at 2.4, four per cent apart across a threefold difference in
//! speed. `building_a_stroke_costs_what_it_should_relative_to_a_fill` gates those
//! in the ordinary suite, which is where a stroker that doubled its output would
//! now be caught without a board at all.

    "\nEach device's lines are two comparisons and a budget. The first three \n\
     are one shape filled two ways and the next two are the same shape \n\
     stroked two ways, so within a group the difference is the route and not \n\
     the content -- and a fill's cost is not an outline's, which is why they \n\
     are not read across. The last line is not part of either. That is a whole \n\
     frame of mixed content -- a tabulated gradient behind, shadowed cards \n\
     over it, a blurred layer on top -- and it is there because a renderer can \n\
     be quick at a hundred and sixty identical rectangles and slow at \n\
     everything an interface is made of.\n\
     \n\
     The `recording` section is the other half, and it needs no device: it is \n\
     what building each of those frames costs before anything is submitted, \n\
     which is where tessellation, stroking, the thin-stroke rule and the \n\
     batching live. A frame pays for its recording and then for its \n\
     execution, so the two sections add -- and neither half's reciprocal is a \n\
     frame rate, which is why a building row leaves that column blank.\n\
     \n\
     Read the two halves against each other and one row inverts. Stroking a \n\
     path is the most expensive frame in the file to build and among the \n\
     cheapest to draw: the stroker emits two contours where a fill emits one, \n\
     and then an outline covers a band of fragments where a fill covers an \n\
     interior. A bench that timed only the drawing made that route look free.\n\
     \n\
     Medians, with the frame ninety-nine hundredths came in under beside \n\
     them. Nothing here passes or fails: these are what this machine did, \n\
     and the balance between the two paths is hardware-dependent by design \n\
     -- see the distance-field section of docs/architecture.md.\n\
     \n\
     The rate is what a median frame would sustain with nothing else in it: \n\
     no present, no vertical blank, and a scene that is a hundred and sixty \n\
     rectangles rather than an interface. Read it against the other paths \n\
     here rather than against a target in `plan.md`, which names a different \n\
     scene and counts a whole frame.\n\
     \n\
     Read each p99 against the median on its own line before reading it as \n\
     a renderer's tail. On a machine with a desktop on it a configuration \n\
     can come back with a median under three milliseconds and a ninety-ninth \n\
     percentile near thirty -- a tail ten times the frame it is the tail of, \n\
     which is this process being descheduled rather than the frame taking \n\
     that long. Which lines do it changes from run to run, and they are the \n\
     ones marked noisy. A p99 worth trusting wants a quiet runner, which is \n\
     where the regression gating this deliberately is not belongs too.\n"
