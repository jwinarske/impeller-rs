//! Every corpus scene on one sheet, for a person to look at.
//!
//! The corpus is compared numerically and thoroughly: backend against backend,
//! device against device, each scene against a mutation of itself. None of that
//! can see a scene that is wrong in a way both implementations agree on. A
//! gradient banded the same way everywhere, a shape drawn in the wrong place, a
//! colour that is arithmetically correct and far too dark -- every comparison
//! here passes on all of them.
//!
//! That last one is not hypothetical. The bundled example rendered into a
//! linear surface and wrote the bytes to a file for a long time, which every
//! viewer reads as sRGB; the picture was uniformly far too dark and nothing in
//! the suite could have said so. It was found by somebody looking at it.
//!
//! So this makes looking cheap. One command, one sheet, and the grid printed
//! alongside so a tile can be found by counting.
//!
//! What it is good for is gross wrongness: a blank tile, a shape in the wrong
//! place, a colour inverted, a scene that is far too dark. It is not good for
//! fine judgement, and the first two things that looked wrong on it were not.
//! One tile appeared to have a grey surround and did not -- black corners, and
//! forty distinct colours along an antialiased edge. Another appeared to blur
//! one of its two shapes and not the other; both were blurred, and the larger
//! one simply shows less of it. Measure before believing either.
//!
//! Written as a PPM for the same reason the example is: every viewer reads one
//! and it needs no encoder, where taking an image dependency to write a nicer
//! file would cost this workspace its pure-Rust build for a convenience.
