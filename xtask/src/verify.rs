//! Running the test suite and saying what did not run.
//!
//! `cargo test` captures the output of a passing test, so a test that decides
//! it cannot run, prints why, and returns says nothing at all: the run reports
//! it as passed and the reason is discarded. Every skip in this workspace works
//! that way, because the alternative — failing when a device lacks a capability
//! — would make the suite unrunnable on the machines the suite exists to cover.
//!
//! That is a reasonable design with one hole in it, which is that nobody sees
//! the skips. This runs the suite with output uncaptured and counts them, so a
//! run reports what it covered rather than only that it was green. It found
//! three tests that had been skipping since they were written, and a whole file
//! of them skipping because of a lock two threads were contending for.
//!
//! The word is the contract. A skip is found by looking for "skipping" in the
//! line, so a test that announces itself any other way is counted as having
//! run -- which is the condition this exists to end, reached from the other
//! side. Four sites said "no backend available" and one called itself a note,
//! and all five were invisible here until
//! `a_skip_says_the_word_the_census_counts` in `xtask/tests/documentation.rs`
//! went looking for them.
//!
//! A skip is not a failure and this does not treat it as one. Some are correct:
//! a device without the advanced-blend extension genuinely cannot render those
//! scenes, and the corpus reports that as coverage it did not get. The point is
//! that the number is visible and has to be looked at.
