//! What this machine's devices can do, gathered and printed.
//!
//! The project spans desktop discrete GPUs down to embedded SoCs driving panels
//! directly, and the layers above the HAL branch on capabilities rather than on
//! which backend is in play. So the first thing anyone bringing up a board
//! needs is the answer to "what does this one report", and the first thing
//! anyone reading a bug report needs is the same answer for the machine it came
//! from.
//!
//! Every device is reported, not only the one a preference would pick. A
//! machine with a discrete GPU and a software rasterizer has two, they differ in
//! ways that decide which paths run — an extension can sit on one and not the
//! other — and a report that showed one would answer the wrong question.
