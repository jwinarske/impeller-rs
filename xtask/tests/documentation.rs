//! The parity table, checked against the thing it describes.
//!
//! `docs/parity.md` makes two kinds of claim that can be wrong quietly. It
//! cites corpus scenes as evidence that a row exists, and those citations were
//! verified once, by hand, on the day the table was written; a scene renamed
//! afterwards leaves a claim pointing at nothing. And it counts its own rows in
//! prose, which is a summary of a table sitting directly above it and therefore
//! a summary that can disagree with it.
//!
//! Both were checked by hand once. Doing it by hand once is how a document
//! starts out true and stops being true, and this table is the answer given to
//! anyone asking what the renderer can do -- so a stale citation is worse than
//! no citation, since it reads as evidence.
//!
//! What this does not check is whether a cited scene actually exercises the row
//! it is cited under. That is a judgment about what a picture demonstrates, and
//! no test makes it. The mechanical part is still worth having: it is the part
//! that rots on its own, without anybody touching the document.

// Reached from a helper rather than from a test body, so clippy's test-code
// exemption does not see it. A failed assumption in a test should stop the
// run; the workspace denies these because a *library* must not.
