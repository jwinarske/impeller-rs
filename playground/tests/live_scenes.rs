//! Every live scene draws something, at every part of its knob's range.
//!
//! The playground is a thing you look at, which makes it exactly the kind of
//! program that rots quietly: a scene that panics or draws nothing is invisible
//! until somebody steps onto it, and nobody steps onto all of them. This runs
//! them all offscreen, so a broken one is a failure rather than a discovery.
//!
//! It is not a golden test and asserts nothing about how they look. Two things
//! only: that drawing does not panic, and that the result is not the background
//! it started from.
