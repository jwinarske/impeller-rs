//! Scenes with a knob, drawn at whatever size the window is.
//!
//! The corpus is authored for comparison: fixed size, fixed parameters, so two
//! backends can be checked against each other. These are the opposite — one
//! parameter you can sweep, drawn at the window's own size, for the questions a
//! still image cannot answer.
//!
//! Two kinds of question in particular:
//!
//! A **continuity** question. Turn a knob through its range and watch for a
//! step where there should be a slope. The gradient scene below crosses the
//! boundary where stops stop fitting in a material and get baked into a texture
//! instead — two entirely different shader paths, which the suite checks agree
//! at one pair of values. Here you can watch the crossing. A pop at four stops
//! is the two paths disagreeing, and no still comparison would show it.
//!
//! A **temporal** question. Marching dashes are the obvious one: a phase that
//! advances every frame shows flicker, popping and reordering that a single
//! frame cannot contain.
